# Loop Android Sample - Download test profiles

These instructions will get you a copy of a Loop sample app for downloading user profiles from the Loop platform for development and testing purposes.

  0. If you havenâ€™t already, signup for a loop account and create an app on the [Loop Developer Portal](https://developer.dev.loop.ms)
  0. Get the sample app
    0. Clone this sample app `git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/Loop-Sample-TestUser-Android.git`
    0. Open it in Android Studio
    0. Add your appId and appToken in `LoopTestUserApplication.java OnCreate`

    ```
        String appId = "YOUR_APP_ID";
        String appToken = "YOUR_APP_TOKEN";
    ```
  0. Create test users in your user dashboard (user link in the left navigation)
  0. Fill in the userId and deviceId in `LoopTestUserApplication.java OnCreate` with a test user's userId and deviceId obtained from the [Loop Developer Portal](https://developer.dev.loop.ms)

    ```
        String userId = "YOUR_USER_ID";
        String deviceId = "YOUR_DEVICE_ID";
    ```
  0. Build and run the app

After this is done, you can see the test profiles in your app. You can use the [Loop-Sample-Hello-Android](https://github.com/Microsoft/Loop-Sample-Hello-Android) test app to send more test signals and see them updated in this app. This is the same mechanism using test signals that the Loop uses when it creates home & work profiles.
